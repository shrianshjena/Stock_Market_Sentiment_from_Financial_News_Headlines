# Determine Stock Market Sentiment from Financial News Headlines

Our goal is to gain investment insights by utilizing sentiment analysis on financial news headlines obtained from FINVIZ.com. By employing natural language processing techniques, we can comprehend the emotional tone expressed in these headlines and determine whether the market perceives a stock positively or negatively. The use of headlines, which are uniform in length and easier to process compared to variable-length articles, facilitates efficient analysis. This analysis allows us to make informed predictions about the market's sentiment toward specific stocks, enabling strategic trading decisions.
