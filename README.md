# Determine Stock Market Sentiment from Financial News Headlines

Our goal is to gain investment insights by utilizing sentiment analysis on financial news
headlines obtained from FINVIZ.com. By employing natural language processing techniques, we
can comprehend the emotional tone expressed in these headlines and determine whether the
market perceives a stock positively or negatively. This analysis allows us to make informed
predictions about the market's sentiment towards specific stocks, enabling strategic trading
decisions.
The use of headlines, which are uniform in length and easier to process compared to variablelength articles, facilitates efficient analysis. Furthermore, sourcing headlines from FINVIZ.com
ensures consistency in language usage, as the site features content from trusted sources with
